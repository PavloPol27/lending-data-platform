# Decisions

- Use WSL2 + uv (instead of pip) + Make for reproducible local dev.
- In v1, payment is already linked to installment. In the next version of the system, apply FIFO allocation logic so that any delayed payment that is made by a customer concerns the earliest DPD (Days Past Due) installment .
